# pymongo-in-godot
I have tried and failed to find a reasonable way to use Mongo in godot
So I have decided to try to use pymongo -a free and easy way to communicate to mongo from python
I have set up a virtual enviroment in  a folder called "venv"
Do not hesitate to constructively critisize this project
